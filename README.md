## Description

The goal of this project is to adapt the idea of **Java Servlets** to **OpenTelemetry** signals.

A **siglet** is a lightweight application that implements the Siglet API and is packaged as a self-contained bundle with all its dependencies (e.g., a fat JAR or a Spring Boot uber JAR).

To run a siglet, you create a pipeline and load it into the Siglet Engine.

Complete examples can be found [here](examples/README.md).
